## TuanTuan Cloud Study

### Introduction

The online study room breaks the limitations of time and space, making it more convenient and versatile than traditional offline study rooms. Therefore, in this context, I developed the "TuanTuan Cloud Study" for students to study online.

**Development Language**：Kotlin

This project uses the MVVM architecture and incorporates Jetpack components and Material Design language. The networking library used is Retrofit.

This project is for learning purposes only.
